# UdacityProject1
#### Project Motivation
This project was completed to satisfy requirements for Udacity Data Science nano degree.
The project is aimed at answering a few questions that could help an AirBnB host in the Seattle, WA area better manage their property based on usage data from 2016. The following questions were answered.
1. Are total listings similar each week day?
2. Are total listings similar each month?
3. Does Utilization vary by weekday?
4. Is Utilization the same for each month?
